# Accident-Analysis-Dashboard-Using-Excel
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of road traffic accidents using Excel and Power BI. It was completed as part of my capstone project at CoreTech Labs, where I served as a Data Scientist Intern. The goal was to uncover accident patterns, identify high-risk conditions, and support road safety initiatives.
