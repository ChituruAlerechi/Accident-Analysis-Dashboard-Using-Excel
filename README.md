# Accident-Analysis-Dashboard-Using-Excel
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of road traffic accidents using Excel. It was completed as part of my capstone project at CoreTech Labs, where I served as a Data Scientist consultant. The goal was to uncover accident patterns, identify high-risk conditions, and support road safety initiatives.

## 
Road traffic accidents present significant public safety concerns, and effectively addressing these challenges often requires overcoming issues related to poorly structured and complex datasets.

To tackle this problem, a comprehensive approach was undertaken to transform unstructured accident data into actionable insights. This involved meticulous data cleaning, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and categorizing vehicle types. Further analysis included calculating key statistical measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation, revealing important trends and risk factors.

An interactive Excel-based dashboard was developed, enabling stakeholders to easily visualize accident frequencies, severities, vehicle involvement, and geographic and environmental conditions. 

The insights from this project have provided a clear foundation for strategic decisions related to emergency response, educational initiatives, and the adoption of vehicle safety technologies.

Overall, the structured analytical approach effectively translated complex road accident data into practical strategies, enhancing road safety, policy planning, and resource allocation.
